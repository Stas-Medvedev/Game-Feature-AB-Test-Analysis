# Game-Feature-AB-Test-Analysis  
Analysis of an A/B test data from 90,000 users using Pandas and hypothesis testing for a mobile game feature. There is a statistically significant 4% difference between retention rates, but there might not be a causal link between the feature and the difference in retention rates. Suggestions for further improvements to the experimentation process are at the end of the Jupyter notebook.
